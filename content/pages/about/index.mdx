  Hello! I'm Aniket, a full stack software engineer based in New Delhi, India.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

Shortly after graduating from [university](https://aktu.ac.in/), I joined the engineering team, where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

 `Java (Core/Advanced)`
 `JavaScript (ES6+)`
 `HTML & (S)CSS`
 `React`
 `Node.js` 

These are not all that is in my stack though as I am also learning Kafka, JMS, MDBs and instant messaging exchanges. I try to learn new things regularly.


Love to here from you!! say hello at [hi@aniketis.online](mailto:)
