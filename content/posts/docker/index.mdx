Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.


Installation :

RHEL/CentOS or Linux -> We have Docker Engine [download for CentOS/RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)

MacOS/Windows -> We have Docker Desktop

> to run docker container from image [the image can be available in hub or from seperate developer]

```bash
docker run --name name-of-the-container -v host-volume-path:path-to-container-volume -d -p 8080:80 name-of-the-image-to-run
```

Explaination :

1. ```docker run``` is used to run an image on a container.
1. ```--name``` flag is used to name the container
1. ```-v``` flag is used to mount a host volume to docker volume ```hostVolume:dockerVolume```
1. ```-d``` is for detached mode to run container
1. ```-p``` is used to bind host port to open continer port for the image ```hostPort:containerPort```

Example : if run on same folder location as the file present we can use $(pwd)

```bash
docker run --name website -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Other useful commands :

> to see all containers available

```bash
docker ps -a
```

> to start/stop container

```bash
docker start/stop name/id of the container
```

> to remove all container 

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

> to execute docker shell

```bash
docker exec -it name-of-the-container bash
```

> Sharing data [volume] between two containers : this will create exact replica of volumne from one container to the new one

Here we are mounting volume of website container to website-copy container

```bash
docker run --name website-copy --volumes-from website -d -p 8081:80 nginx:latest
```


### dockerfile

1. Build our own image [contains set of commands to create an image] [doc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

Let's create a dockerfile and after that an image from it.

#### Docker image

1. image is a template for creating environment of your choice
1. Snapshot 
1. It has everything to run your Apps
1. This include OS, Software, App code

A sample Dockerfile example is provided below assuming you are creating it in same folder where your Static website source is available

> create a file name as Dockerfile [please note there is no extension to it]

Inside Dockerfile

```bash
FROM nginx:latest
ADD . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Explanation:

1. ```FROM``` keyword is used to specify the base image which our own image will be based on. We always create an image on top of a Base img.
1. ```ADD``` keyword is used to add everything from one directory to the specified directory. Here,  . (dot) represents current directory and it says "put everything in current directory to /usr/share/nginx/html"


This is a very small and simple Dockerfile, from this we can create our own image

To create image from Dockerfile

```bash
docker build --tag website:latest .
```

Explanation:

1. docker build is used to build image from Dockerfile
1. --tag or -t is used to provide name:tag to the image [here it is website:latest] 
1. . (dot) is for the path of Dockerfile

> you can see the images with docker image ls

Now you can run a container with this image that we have created.

```bash
docker run --name website -d -p 8080:80 website:latest 
```

> go to localhost:8080 [or url:8080] to see the website up and running.
 Any number of containers can be created using that image
 
Now we are going to create an API and make things a little bit complax.

> A sample Dockerfile is given here assuming Dockerfile is created at same place as the project (that's why we are using ADD . .)

```bash
FROM node:latest
WORKDIR /app
ADD . .
RUN npm install
CMD node index.js
```

> We have .dockerignore file that contains items that needed to be ignored

```bash
node_modules
Dockerfile
.git
```
