Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.

> to run docker container from image [the image can be available in hub or from seperate developer]

```bash
docker run --name name-of-the-container -v host-volume-path:path-to-container-volume -d -p 8080:80 name-of-the-image-to-run
```

Explaination :

1. ```docker run``` is used to run an image on a container.
1. ```--name``` flag is used to name the container
1. ```-v``` flag is used to mount a host volume to docker volume ```hostVolume:dockerVolume```
1. ```-d``` is for detached mode to run container
1. ```-p``` is used to bind host port to open continer port for the image ```hostPort:containerPort```

Example : if run on same folder location as the file present we can use $(pwd)

```bash
docker run --name website -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Other useful commands :

> to see all containers available

```bash
docker ps -a
```

> to start/stop container

```bash
docker start/stop name/id of the container
```

> to remove all container 

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

> to execute docker shell

```bash
docker exec -it name-of-the-container bash
```
